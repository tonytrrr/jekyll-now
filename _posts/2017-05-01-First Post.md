After years on debating on whether I should take coding seriously, I have come to the decision to finally do it. Why? You may ask. I will by best to explain to you through out this blog as the journey continues.

Please excuse my language and my command of grammar since I'm writting these posts as a mean to relieve stress from the coding excersices.

Enjoy!
